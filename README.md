# 🗄️ SQL Server & T-SQL Development Portfolio

## 🚀 Overview
Welcome to my Database Development repository! This project is a comprehensive collection of my work in **SQL** and **T-SQL**. It demonstrates a strong foundation in database design, advanced querying, and server-side programmability using **Microsoft SQL Server**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is divided into two main modules to showcase different levels of database expertise:

## 1. [SQL Mastery](./SQL)
*Focuses on the fundamentals of data retrieval and analysis.*
* **DML & DDL:** Designing tables and managing data efficiently.
* **Joins & Subqueries:** Connecting complex relational data models.
* **Aggregations:** Generating business reports using grouping and summary functions.
* **Views:** Creating data abstractions for cleaner access.

## 2. [Advanced T-SQL](./T-SQL)
*Focuses on database programming, automation, and security.*
* **Programmability:** Stored Procedures, Scalar/Table Functions, and Triggers.
* **Control Flow:** Implementation of `IF...ELSE`, `Loops`, and `Error Handling`.
* **Data Integrity:** Transaction management (`COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) and ACID properties.
* **Security:** Dynamic SQL implementation and **SQL Injection** prevention.
* **Modern Techniques:** CTEs (Common Table Expressions) and Window Functions.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Database Engine:** Microsoft SQL Server (T-SQL)
* **Tooling:** SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
* **Concepts:** Database Normalization, Performance Optimization, and Security Best Practices.

## 📈 Learning Journey
Each folder contains scripts that I developed while mastering SQL Server. The goal was to build a deep understanding of how to handle data at scale and ensure that the backend logic is robust, secure, and high-performing.
