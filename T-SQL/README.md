# 🛠️ T-SQL Programming & Advanced Database Logic

## 🚀 Overview
This repository focuses on **Transact-SQL (T-SQL)**, demonstrating the ability to move beyond simple queries into full database programmability. It contains advanced scripts for automating tasks, ensuring data integrity, and optimizing server-side logic in **SQL Server**.

## 🏗️ Technical Proficiencies

## 1. Procedural Programming & Control Flow
* **Logic Flow:** Implementation of complex logic using `IF...ELSE` statements, `CASE` expressions, and `WHILE` loops.
* **Variable Management:** Expert use of **Local Variables**, **Table Variables**, and **Temporary Tables (`#Temp`)** for efficient data manipulation.
* **Error Handling:** Robust implementation of `TRY...CATCH` blocks to manage exceptions and ensure system stability.

## 2. Programmable Objects (Stored Procedures & Functions)
* **Stored Procedures:** Building reusable, parameterized scripts for business logic and data security.
* **Custom Functions:** Development of **Scalar-Valued** and **Table-Valued Functions (TVFs)** to simplify complex calculations.
* **Dynamic SQL:** Crafting flexible queries while maintaining awareness of **SQL Injection** risks and prevention techniques.

## 3. Data Integrity & Automation (Triggers)
* **Automated Actions:** Implementation of **`AFTER` Triggers** for auditing and synchronization.
* **Custom Logic Overrides:** Using **`INSTEAD OF` Triggers** to handle complex views and data validation.

## 4. Advanced Data Retrieval Techniques
* **Common Table Expressions (CTE):** Writing clean, readable, and recursive queries for hierarchical data.
* **Window Functions:** Leveraging analytical tools like `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, and `LEAD/LAG` for advanced reporting.
* **Cursors:** Managed use of Cursors for row-by-row processing when set-based logic is insufficient.

## 5. Transaction Management
* **Data Consistency:** Mastery of **ACID properties** using `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` to ensure atomic operations and prevent data corruption.

## 🛡️ Security Mindset
* **SQL Injection Defense:** This module includes specific examples of identifying and preventing SQL injection attacks through proper input sanitization and parameterized queries.

### 💡 Why T-SQL?
These scripts prove the ability to handle **Backend Logic** directly at the database level, reducing network latency and improving application performance.
