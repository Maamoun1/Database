# 📊 SQL Mastery: Data Analysis & Relational Database Design

## 🚀 Overview
This repository is a comprehensive showcase of **SQL (Structured Query Language)** skills. It features a wide range of queries from basic data retrieval to complex analytical reporting, demonstrating a deep understanding of extracting business insights from relational databases.

## 🛠️ Core SQL Proficiencies

## 1. Advanced Data Filtering & Selection
* **Precision Filtering:** Mastery of `WHERE` clauses using `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE` (Wildcards), and Logical Operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`).
* **Data Refinement:** Proficient use of **`DISTINCT`**, **`TOP`**, and **`TOP PERCENT`** for controlled data sampling.
* **Null Handling:** Specialized queries to manage and report on missing data using `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL`.

## 2. Complex Data Aggregation & Grouping
* **Summary Statistics:** Expert use of Aggregate Functions: `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()`.
* **Segmented Reporting:** Advanced **`GROUP BY`** operations to categorize data (e.g., reporting vehicle counts per manufacturer).
* **Post-Aggregation Filtering:** Using **`HAVING`** to filter grouped results based on specific aggregate conditions.

## 3. Relational Data Modeling (Joins)
* **Multi-Table Integration:** Seamlessly combining data using **`INNER JOIN`**, **`LEFT JOIN`**, **`RIGHT JOIN`**, and **`FULL OUTER JOIN`**.
* **Deep Relationships:** Experience in joining 3+ tables to build comprehensive data views.
* **Relational Logic:** Using **`EXISTS`** and **`NOT EXISTS`** for high-performance subquery validation.

## 4. Computational Logic & Transformations
* **Conditional Logic:** Implementing complex **`CASE`** statements for data categorization (e.g., creating custom tax brackets or describing data in words).
* **Arithmetic & Aliasing:** Performing on-the-fly calculations (Yearly Salary, Age, Tax) and using **`AS`** for clean, readable output.
* **Data Casting:** Using **`CAST`** to handle floating-point divisions for accurate percentage calculations.

## 5. Database Objects & Optimization
* **Views:** Creating reusable and simplified data abstractions (e.g., `ActiveEmployees`, `VehicleMasterDetails`).
* **Set Operations:** Combining result sets using **`UNION`** and **`UNION ALL`**.
* **Optimization:** Utilizing **`TOP 1`** inside `EXISTS` clauses to optimize query execution speed.

## 📈 Real-World Business Scenarios Implemented
* **Industry Analysis:** Detailed reports on vehicle specifications, fuel types, and manufacturing trends.
* **HR Reporting:** Calculating employee salaries, bonuses, and status tracking.
* **Performance Benchmarking:** Identifying records that exceed or fall below **Average** benchmarks using subqueries.
